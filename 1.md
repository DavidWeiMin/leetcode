### comment to author

The authors proposed a list of principles on the benefits of increasing manufacturing process flexibility. The guidelines are as follows:

- try to equalize the number of plants (measured in total units pf capacity) to which each product in the chain is directly connected;
- try to equalize the number of products (measured in total units of expected demand) to which each plant in the chain is directly connected; and
- try to create a circuit(s) that encompasses as many plants and products as possible.



If there are some shortcomings to be said in this paper,  it can only be its results. All of results can be expected rationally, that is, its results are not exciting enough for the readers. It seems to be tell us a common knowledge in another way. Maybe the reason is that this paper is mostly inspired by author's intuition. On the other hand, the strong intuition is also why this paper can be written clearly and read easily. I think it is better that the results of research based on intuition are unexpected. I would not say this research consistent with intuition is bad, on the contrary, this paper is good enough.

Overall, this paper is well-written and not exciting or interesting enough as mentioned above.
